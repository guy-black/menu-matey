- if given a file read it in and split it into it's 3 sections
  - remove all comments
  - check to see that there are only 3 lines of text that start on column 1, "Meta:", "Body:", "Template:"
    -- if not, set ucfmlfile appmodel = ParseError "Could not identify the three sections.
                                                   please ensure Meta, Body, and Template tags all start
                                                   on colun one and nothing else but comments do"


-- new idea for parsing
dancing around quoted characters while parsing comments is tedious and annoying
this will be even more annoying down the line as no quoted characters should be parsed
as ucfml code or symbols

keep same general parsing pipeline but first create a dequoted text
data DequotedText = DequotedText
    { quoText :: Map Token Text -- token to label the quote and where it will go when requoting text
    , deqText :: Text -- Text with a special token everywhere quoted text should be in there
    }

dequoteText :: Text -> DequotedText
dequoteText tx = -- replace all the quotes in the text with unique tokens that the quote will be paired with in Map

requoteText :: DequotedText -> Text
requoteText (DequotedText m t) =
  -- find every unique token in t to replace with it's corresponding text in m
- parse meta into `UCFMLmeta`
  look for 4 tags starting on the third column, "Title:", "About:", "Author:", "Upsream Docs"

- parse body into `UCFMLbody`

- parse template into `UCFMLtemplate`

- display option settings

- generate filled in template

- either write file or pass back into menumate
