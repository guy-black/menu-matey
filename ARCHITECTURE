Library will have funtions to
  - parse a ucfml model
  - generate a UCFMLmodel date structure
  - define provide datatypes and functions to do the stuff

types and functions rough drafts

library file structure

src/


App will have to

-- on initial launch --

  - check if a file was passed as an argument on execution
  - if not prompt for a ucfml model
  - if yes attempt to parse the file as a UCFMLmodel
    - if failed, display relevant errors
    - if successful, render all text and option selectorrs appropriateley as well as a button labeled "generate" or something to that effect
      - if all options marked "required" havea an associated value, and all options pass their validator check then make the generate button clickable
      - else the button is greyed out and empty
    - generate a Map Text UcfmlVal value to hold option refvar and values
    - label highlight all options that are "required" and don't have an active (or default on first load) value selected

-- upon any user interaction with options --

  - visually change input to show new value
  - check if the new selected value passes its validator check
    - if not then display relevant error
    - if so then update the Map Text UcfmlVal so that the key at refvar has the value of the optipon
  - if the option was marked required and the new state has a value that passes the validator, then unhiglight, else highlight

-- on clicking the generate button --

  - find where to save generated files
    - if files have a default path for location, ask user if that is where they'd like to save the files
    - else ask user where to save files to
  - process each file's lines from first to last
    -
